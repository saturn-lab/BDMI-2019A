## hashing table

- mapping from certain function into buckets of matrices

- randomness avoids collisions
  - make expectation for data in each bucket less than 2
  - $E[\quad] = 1 + \frac{n-1}{n} \leq 2 $
- hash families
  - a collection of hash functions
- universal hash families
  - random two members collide by less than $1/n$

insert/delete/search in O(1)
